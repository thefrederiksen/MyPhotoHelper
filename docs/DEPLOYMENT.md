# Deployment Guide for MyPhotoHelper

## Overview
MyPhotoHelper uses a **fully automated** deployment process through GitHub Actions. Simply create a git tag, and everything else is handled automatically.

## ðŸš€ Quick Release Process

### One Command Release
```bash
# Create and push a new version tag (e.g., v1.3.1)
git tag v1.3.1
git push origin v1.3.1
```

That's it! GitHub Actions will automatically:
1. âœ… Update version in project file
2. âœ… Build the release
3. âœ… Create the installer
4. âœ… Create GitHub release
5. âœ… Update AutoUpdater XML
6. âœ… Commit version changes back to main

## Version Management (Fully Automated)

### Version Format Guidelines
- **Git Tags**: `v1.3.1` (three parts with 'v' prefix)
- **Everything else is automated!**

### What Gets Updated Automatically
1. **Project File** (`src/MyPhotoHelper/MyPhotoHelper.csproj`)
   - All version fields updated to match tag
   - Committed back to main branch after release

2. **AutoUpdater XML** (`update.xml`)
   - Updated with new version and download URL
   - Committed back to main branch after release

3. **Installer** (`installer.iss`)
   - Version updated during build process

4. **GitHub Release**
   - Created with installer attached
   - Marked as latest release

## Detailed Release Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Code
```bash
# Make sure all changes are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# Ensure all tests pass
dotnet test src/MyPhotoHelper.Tests
```

### Step 2: Create Release
```bash
# Create version tag (semantic versioning)
git tag v1.3.1

# Push tag to trigger automated release
git push origin v1.3.1
```

### Step 3: Monitor Progress
1. Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/thefrederiksen/MyPhotoHelper/actions)
2. Watch the "Release with AutoUpdater.NET" workflow
3. Once complete, check [Releases](https://github.com/thefrederiksen/MyPhotoHelper/releases)

### Step 4: Verify Release
The workflow will automatically:
- Build with the new version number
- Create installer with correct version
- Upload to GitHub Releases
- Update `update.xml` for auto-updater
- Commit version changes to main branch

## No Manual Version Updates Needed! ðŸŽ‰

The GitHub Actions workflow now:
- Extracts version from git tag
- Updates project file automatically
- Ensures version consistency everywhere
- Commits changes back to main

You **never** need to manually update version numbers anywhere!

## Testing Auto-Update

After release completes:
1. Run a previous version of the application
2. Go to Help â†’ Check for Updates
3. Verify it detects and downloads the new version

## Common Scenarios

### Creating a Major Release
```bash
git tag v2.0.0
git push origin v2.0.0
```

### Creating a Patch Release
```bash
git tag v1.3.2
git push origin v1.3.2
```

### Creating a Pre-release (Beta)
```bash
git tag v1.4.0-beta.1
git push origin v1.4.0-beta.1
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Workflow fails at "Update main branch" step
**Cause**: Branch protection rules preventing push
**Solution**: 
- Check repository settings â†’ Branches
- Allow GitHub Actions to bypass protection rules
- Or manually merge the auto-generated PR

### Issue: Version not updating in application
**Cause**: Build cache issue
**Solution**: The workflow now handles this automatically by updating the project file before building

### Issue: Auto-updater not detecting new version
**Cause**: `update.xml` not updated
**Solution**: Check if the workflow completed successfully. The XML is updated automatically after release verification.

## Emergency Manual Release

If GitHub Actions is unavailable:

```powershell
# Use the prepare-release script
.\scripts\prepare-release.ps1 -Version 1.3.1

# Or manually:
# 1. Update version in MyPhotoHelper.csproj
# 2. Build release
dotnet publish src/MyPhotoHelper/MyPhotoHelper.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o publish

# 3. Create installer (update version in installer.iss first)
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer.iss

# 4. Create GitHub release manually and upload installer
# 5. Update update.xml manually
```

## Version History Format
- v1.3.1 - 2025-08-XX - [Description]
- v1.3.0 - 2025-08-08 - Major UI redesign with Tailwind CSS
- v1.2.8 - 2025-08-04 - Bug fixes and performance improvements

## Best Practices

1. **Always use semantic versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
2. **Test locally before tagging**: Run the application and tests
3. **Write clear commit messages**: They appear in release notes
4. **Monitor the GitHub Actions workflow**: Ensure it completes successfully
5. **Verify auto-update works**: Test from a previous version

## Release Checklist

### Before Creating Tag
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Application runs without errors
- [ ] Changes are committed and pushed to main
- [ ] Release notes prepared (in your head or written down)

### After Pushing Tag
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow started
- [ ] Workflow completed successfully
- [ ] Release appears on GitHub releases page
- [ ] Installer is attached to release
- [ ] update.xml shows new version in main branch
- [ ] Project file shows new version in main branch

## Summary

The deployment process is now **fully automated**:
1. Push code changes to main
2. Create and push a version tag
3. Everything else happens automatically!

No more manual version updates. No more version mismatches. Just tag and deploy! ðŸš€
