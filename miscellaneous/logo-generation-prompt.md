## Prompt for AI Logo Generation

---

**Create a modern, professional logo for "MyPhotoHelper" - an AI-powered photo organization and management application.**

**Product Description:**
MyPhotoHelper is a free, open-source Windows desktop application that helps users organize and manage their photo collections using AI technology. The app automatically discovers photos on a user's computer, extracts metadata (dates, locations, camera info), categorizes images intelligently, detects duplicates, and provides a beautiful interface for browsing memories.

**Key Features to Consider:**
- Photo organization and management
- AI-powered categorization
- Memory preservation and discovery
- Location-based photo mapping
- Duplicate detection and cleanup
- Metadata extraction and analysis
- User-friendly gallery interface

**Logo Requirements:**
- **Style**: Modern, clean, professional yet friendly
- **Colors**: Use a technology-friendly palette (blues, greens, or modern gradients)
- **Elements**: Should incorporate photography/camera elements and/or AI/organization themes
- **Format**: Vector-style design that works well at different sizes
- **Text**: Include "MyPhotoHelper" text or could be icon-only with separate wordmark
- **Audience**: Home users, families, photography enthusiasts

**Design Ideas to Explore:**
1. **Camera + AI Theme**: Combine a camera/photo icon with AI elements (circuit patterns, neural network nodes, or geometric AI symbols)
2. **Organization Theme**: Photos being sorted, folders, or organizational grid patterns
3. **Memory/Discovery Theme**: Photo frames arranged in an artistic way, or photos "floating" in an organized pattern
4. **Abstract Modern**: Geometric shapes that suggest both photography and intelligent organization

**Technical Specifications:**
- Should work well as a small app icon (16x16, 32x32, 64x64 pixels)
- Should be recognizable in the Windows system tray
- Needs to work on both light and dark backgrounds
- Prefer SVG-style clean lines and shapes over photorealistic designs

**Color Suggestions:**
- Primary: Modern blues (#2563eb, #3b82f6) or teals (#0891b2, #06b6d4)
- Accent: Warm orange/amber (#f59e0b, #f97316) for highlights
- Alternative: Gradient combinations (blue to purple, teal to blue)
- Neutral: Use white/light grays for contrast when needed

**Examples of Style Direction:**
- Think along the lines of modern tech company logos (clean, minimal, memorable)
- Similar aesthetic to apps like Google Photos, Adobe Lightroom, or Apple Photos
- Should feel trustworthy and professional, but not corporate or cold
- Friendly enough for home users, sophisticated enough for power users

**Variations Needed:**
1. Full logo with text
2. Icon-only version
3. Horizontal layout version
4. Monochrome/single color version for different contexts

**Avoid:**
- Overly complex designs with too many small details
- Clich√© photography elements (old film cameras, film strips)
- Generic folder icons
- Outdated design trends or overly "techy" elements

Please create 3-4 different logo concepts exploring different themes and styles within these guidelines.
