# System Tray Menu Fix Documentation

## Problem
The user reported two issues:
1. The system tray menu was not appearing when clicking the icon
2. The console window was still visible despite attempts to hide it

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Console Window Visibility
- Removed unused `SW_SHOW` constant from Program.cs to fix build warning
- Console is now properly hidden at startup using Windows API

### 2. Fixed System Tray Menu
Updated SystemTrayService.cs to properly show context menu:
- Changed from handling only right-click to handling both left and right clicks
- Used reflection to call internal `ShowContextMenu` method for proper Windows behavior
- Removed double-click handler since single click now shows menu

## Implementation Details

### SystemTrayService.cs Changes
```csharp
// Handle mouse click events - Windows system tray typically shows menu on both clicks
_trayIcon.MouseClick += (s, e) =>
{
    if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left || e.Button == MouseButtons.Right)
    {
        // Show the context menu at cursor position
        var methodInfo = typeof(NotifyIcon).GetMethod("ShowContextMenu", 
            System.Reflection.BindingFlags.Instance | System.Reflection.BindingFlags.NonPublic);
        methodInfo?.Invoke(_trayIcon, null);
    }
};
```

This uses reflection to call the internal `ShowContextMenu` method which properly handles Windows system tray conventions.

## Testing
1. Close any running instances of FaceVault
2. Run `FaceVault.exe` 
3. Console window should be hidden immediately
4. Click (left or right) on system tray icon to see menu with:
   - Open FaceVault
   - Show Console
   - Exit

## Notes
- The menu now appears on both left and right click, following Windows conventions
- Console visibility can be toggled via "Show Console" menu item
- Application starts with console hidden by default
