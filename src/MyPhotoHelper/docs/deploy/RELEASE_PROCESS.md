# MyPhotoHelper Release Process

This guide explains how to create and publish a new release that will automatically update for all users.

## Quick Steps to Release

### 1. Update Version Number
Edit `src\MyPhotoHelper\MyPhotoHelper.csproj` and update these three lines:
```xml
<AssemblyVersion>1.0.1.0</AssemblyVersion>
<FileVersion>1.0.1.0</FileVersion>
<ProductVersion>1.0.1</ProductVersion>
```

### 2. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare release v1.0.1"
git push
```

### 3. Create and Push a Version Tag
```bash
git tag v1.0.1
git push origin v1.0.1
```

**That's it!** GitHub Actions will automatically:
- Build the release
- Create Squirrel packages
- Upload to GitHub Releases
- Users will get the update notification within 6 hours

## What Happens Next

1. **GitHub Actions** (5-10 minutes)
   - Builds the application
   - Creates Setup.exe installer
   - Publishes to GitHub Releases
   - Check progress at: https://github.com/thefrederiksen/MyPhotoHelper/actions

2. **User Updates** (within 6 hours)
   - App checks for updates every 6 hours
   - Users see notification: "Update available: Version 1.0.1"
   - Click "Restart Now" applies the update

## Version Numbering Guide

Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **PATCH** (1.0.1): Bug fixes, small improvements
- **MINOR** (1.1.0): New features, backwards compatible
- **MAJOR** (2.0.0): Breaking changes

## Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating a release:

- [ ] Test the application locally
- [ ] Update version in MyPhotoHelper.csproj
- [ ] Run `build-release.bat X.X.X` locally to test build
- [ ] Commit all changes
- [ ] Push to main branch

## Manual Release (If GitHub Actions Fails)

1. **Build locally**:
   ```cmd
   build-release.bat 1.0.1 "Bug fixes and improvements"
   ```

2. **Create GitHub Release manually**:
   - Go to https://github.com/thefrederiksen/MyPhotoHelper/releases/new
   - Tag: `v1.0.1`
   - Title: `Release v1.0.1`
   - Upload these files from `Releases` folder:
     - `Setup.exe` (rename to `MyPhotoHelper-Setup.exe`)
     - `RELEASES`
     - `MyPhotoHelper-1.0.1-full.nupkg`

## Troubleshooting Releases

**GitHub Action fails**
- Check: https://github.com/thefrederiksen/MyPhotoHelper/actions
- Common issues:
  - Missing GitHub token permissions
  - Build errors in code
  - Tag format must be `vX.X.X`

**Users not getting updates**
- Updates check every 6 hours
- Users can manually check: System tray â†’ Check for Updates
- Firewall might block GitHub access

**Emergency Rollback**
If a release has critical issues:
1. Delete the release on GitHub (keeps the tag)
2. Fix the issue
3. Push a new patch version (e.g., 1.0.2)

## Release Notes Best Practices

3. Core features still function
4. No startup crashes

## Summary

Creating a release is as simple as:

2. Commit and push
3. Tag with `git tag vX.X.X` and push tag
4. Wait 5-10 minutes for automatic build
5. Users get updates within 6 hours

No manual building or uploading needed - it's all automated!
