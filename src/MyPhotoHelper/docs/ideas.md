4. create the feature we used to have in strypix where the user can reorganize all images underneath a particular directory If he drops images into that folder and we could call this Stripe Pick still but we can also call it something else any images in that folder will automatically be organized in year and month so but it will also lose the original file names
6. remember to add location so people can sort and find pictures at geotag locations
7. verbose logging should always be turned off and only turned on if we want to debug. right now it seems like it's always on and turned off during file scan which seems like a bad way to do it
