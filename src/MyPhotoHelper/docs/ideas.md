1. when showing the daily images make sure there is a link to open Windows Explorer to the folder that you are interested in Now just open the image itself often we want to go and see where the image is located
2. on the duplicates page we want to show the directory of both images That will make it easier for the user to choose which one to delete one might be in a temporary folder or one might be in their main so that would kind of be helpful
3. when we display the images on the page we need to look at the rotation some images have been rotated I'm not sure where the rotation is stored if it's by the metadata in the image or something windows stores outside but when I look at images in Windows they are right side up but when I look at them in our application they're sometimes upside down
4. create the feature we used to have in stride picks where the user can reorganize all images underneath a particular directory If he drops images into that folder and we could call this Stripe Pick still but we can also call it something else any images in that folder will automatically be organized in year and month so but it will also lose the original file names
5. we should add a feature to convert the annoying Apple images heic to something else and we should figure out what would be the best conversion we can do JPEG or PNGS but either of the two or maybe there's a better format for Windows and we should try to do it so we lose as little quality as possible And then on that conversion page we should write what the benefits of HEIC is and why it would be better to convert into something else This would also be a example probably to use some Python code because there's probably going to be more libraries in Python than they're on C sharp
6. remember to add location so people can sort and find pictures at geotag locations
7. verbose logging should always be turned off and only turned on if we want to debug. right now it seems like it's always on and turned off during file scan which seems like a bad way to do it
8. we need to add background scanning So when the server starts up it automatically just runs background scanning either that or we should add a service that does this separately installs on your windows machine
