# PR #26 Critical Issues - Fixed

## Summary of Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ FIXED - Compilation Error
**Issue**: The `NavigateToIndex` method in `ImageViewerService.cs` was reported as incomplete.
**Status**: The method was already complete (lines 114-123). No fix needed.

### 2. ✅ FIXED - Memory Leak
**Issue**: Timer disposal in `FullScreenViewer.razor` didn't properly unsubscribe from the Elapsed event handler.
**Fix Applied**: 
- Changed from anonymous lambda to named method `OnHideControlsTimerElapsed`
- Properly unsubscribe from event before disposal
- Stop timer before disposal
- Set timer to null after disposal

### 3. ✅ FIXED - Security Vulnerability (eval usage)
**Issue**: Using `eval` for JavaScript execution is a security risk.
**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `eval` usage from `PreloadImage` method
- Added safe `preloadImage` JavaScript function in `_Host.cshtml`
- Function validates input and creates Image objects safely

### 4. ✅ FIXED - Path Traversal Vulnerability
**Issue**: The ImagesController lacked validation against directory traversal attacks.
**Fix Applied**:
- Added validation to check for ".." in paths
- Added check for rooted paths
- Added validation to ensure resolved path stays within scan directory
- Applied to all 4 instances in the controller

### 5. ✅ FIXED - Missing ARIA Labels
**Issue**: Missing accessibility labels on interactive elements.
**Fix Applied**:
- Added `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` to overlay
- Added `aria-label` to all buttons
- Added proper ARIA labels for loading states
- Improved overall accessibility

### 6. ✅ FIXED - Race Conditions
**Issue**: Rapid image navigation could cause race conditions.
**Fix Applied**:
- Added `CancellationTokenSource` for image loading
- Added `SemaphoreSlim` to prevent concurrent navigation
- Cancel previous loading operations when navigating
- Proper cleanup in Dispose method

### 7. ✅ FIXED - Error Boundaries
**Issue**: FullScreenViewer needed proper error boundary wrapping.
**Fix Applied**:
- Moved FullScreenViewer inside AppErrorBoundary in Gallery.razor
- Ensures errors are caught and handled gracefully

## Build Status
✅ **Build succeeded with 0 errors and 0 warnings**

## Files Modified
1. `src/MyPhotoHelper/Components/Shared/FullScreenViewer.razor` - Fixed memory leak, race conditions, accessibility
2. `src/MyPhotoHelper/Pages/_Host.cshtml` - Added safe preloadImage function
3. `src/MyPhotoHelper/Controllers/ImagesController.cs` - Fixed path traversal vulnerability
4. `src/MyPhotoHelper/Pages/Gallery.razor` - Wrapped FullScreenViewer in error boundary

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test rapid navigation between images to verify no race conditions
2. Test accessibility with screen readers
3. Verify path traversal attacks are blocked
4. Confirm no memory leaks during extended usage
5. Test error handling with invalid images
